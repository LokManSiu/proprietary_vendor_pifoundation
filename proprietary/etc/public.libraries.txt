# The linker only allows apps to open a fixed set of native libraries, so we
# need to explicitly tell it about additional native libraries that our
# boards provide.
#
# This file must go in /vendor/etc/public.libraries.txt. If additional native
# libraries are needed, create a new custom file but make sure it contains
# at least the libraries listed here.
